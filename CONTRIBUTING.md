# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure the following tools are installed:

* Python 3.9+
* Node.js 18+
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Git
* Docker (optional but recommended)

---

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mind-mitra.git
cd mind-mitra
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 6. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd mindmitra-frontend
npm install
```

### 7. Run the Application

Using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Or run services manually:

Backend:

# MongoDB Local Setup

Ensure MongoDB is installed and running before starting the backend.

### Verify Installation

```bash
mongod --version
```

### Start MongoDB

Linux/macOS:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

Windows:

```bash
net start MongoDB
```

### Verify Connection

```bash
mongosh
```

If the MongoDB shell opens successfully, your local database server is running correctly.

## Step 3 — Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

or

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-fix
```

---

## Step 4 — Make Your Changes
